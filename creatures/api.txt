* Settings (minetest.conf):

	enable_damage = false: When the damage system is off, mobs will not attack. Mobs that would otherwise attack a creature will instead consider avoiding them.
	only_peaceful_mobs = false: When enabled, only mobs that don't have the ability to attack will spawn.
	fast_mobs = false: Whether mobs can run. This should only be turned on when players have the "fast" privilege by default, to ensure balanced gameplay.
	pathfinding = false: Enables mob pathfinding system. Highly experimental, only use for testing purposes!

* creatures.player_default = "creatures:ghost": Players who aren't part of a race are set to this creature. Typically applies to new players who join the server for the first time.

* creatures:register_creature("creatures:ghost", {..}): Defines a new creature, with the current parameters:

- Common parameters (applied to both creatures and players):
	icon = "mobs_*_icon.png": Icon for this creature, indicating what a player or mob is. Players see it in the inventory menu or the HUD.
	hp_max = 20: Mobs and players are born with this amount of health, and cannot gain more than it.
	armor = 100: Armor decides how much damage gets absorbed.
	collisionbox = {-0.5, 0, -0.5, 0.5, 2, 0.5}: Collosion box size. (TODO: Currently works only for mobs, engine implementation needed for players!)
	visual = "sprite": Visual type of the player and mob.
	mesh = "": 3D model of the player and mob, when mesh visual is used.
	textures = {"clear.png", ...}: Textures used by the player and mob.
	textures = {{"clear.png", ...}, ...}: Texture sets used by the player and mob. When defined like this, a skin is randomly chosen for each creature.
	visual_size = {x=1, y=1}: Scales the visual of the player and mob.
	animation = {speed = 0, stand = {1, 31}, ...}: List of animation ranges, containing the following entries: speed, stand_start, stand_end, walk_start, walk_end, run_start, run_end, punch_start, punch_end.
	sounds = {random_idle = "filename", ...}: A list containing sound effects for various actions. Valid entries: random_idle, random_attack, random_follow, random_avoid, attack, damage, die.
	makes_footstep_sound = false: Whether the player and mob make footstep sounds while walking. (TODO: Currently works only for mobs, engine implementation needed for players!)
	env_damage = {water = 0, ...}: Enrivonment damage. Valid entries: water, lava, light.
	physics = {speed = 1, ...}: Modifies player and mob movement, as an offset to the physics settings in minetest.conf. Valid entries: speed, jump, gravity.
	teams = {monsters = 1, ...}: Contains an interest list, where 1 means "pro" and -1 means "con". Friend or foe relationships are determined based on how many things two creatures have in common here.

- Mob only parameters:
	drops = {{name = "default:sword_bronze", chance = 40, min = 1, max = 1,}, ...}: Contains a list of items and probabilities, which determines what the player gets after killing a mob.
	on_rightclick = function(self, clicker) {...}: A custom function can be assigned to this, which will be executed when the mob is right-clicked by a player.
	attack_damage = 1: How much damage the mob deals each punch or shot.
	attack_type = "melee": Can be "melee" (mob punches the player) or "shoot" (mob throws projectiles toward the player).
	nodes = {{nodes = "default:dirt", ...}, ...}: A list of parameters, which specifies how mobs react to certain nodes. Each entry represents one target per mob. Parameters include:
		nodes = {"default:dirt", ...}: List of nodes or node groups that mobs will search for.
		light_min = 0: Minimum light level the node most have to be considered an objective.
		light_max = 15: Maximum light level the node most have to be considered an objective.
		avoid = false: If true, the mob avoids this node opposed to walking toward it.
		priority = 0: Target priority. The higher, the more importance the mob will give to this node.
	traits = {attack_interval = {1, 1}, ...}: Personality traits. Each individual mob gets a value between min and max when it first spawns. Actor mobs persist those settings between server restarts. Default traits:
		attack_interval = {1, 1}: How many seconds the mob shoots or punches. Lower means a greater attack skill.
		think = {1, 1}: How many seconds the mob makes new decisions or takes actions. AI speed is this value when idle, half this value when following or avoiding, and a tenth this value when attacking. Lower values mean smarter mobs. Do not abuse this, low values also mean more server load!
		vision = {15, 15}: View distance of the mob, and the range in which other creatures are detected and pursued.
		loyalty = {0.5, 0.5}: How probable it is that the mob will follow allies around and defend them. Note that ghosts can only possess mobs that are following them. Must range between 0 and 1!
		fear = {0.5, 0.5}: Likeliness of the mob running away from enemies (if aggressivity doesn't succeed first). Must range between 0 and 1!
		aggressivity = {0.5, 0.5}: Likeliness of the mob to attack enemies (if fear doesn't succeed first). Must range between 0 and 1!
		determination = {0.5, 0.5}: Lower values make it more likely for a mob to drop distant targets and abandon a task. Must range between 0 and 1!
	teams_target = {attack = true, avoid = true, follow = true}: What types of targets this mob will automatically add or change based on team relationships. Can be nil for default behavior.
	on_activate = function(self, staticdata, dtime_s) ... end: Function executed when the mob is activated. By default, this should call the logic_mob_activate function.
	on_step = function(self, dtime) ... end: Function executed each step. By default, this should call the logic_mob_step function.
	on_punch = function(self, hitter) ... end: Function executed when the mob is punched. By default, this should call the logic_mob_punch function.
	on_rightclick = function(self, clicker) ... end: Function executed when the mob is right-clicked. By default, this should call the logic_mob_rightclick function.

- Player only parameters:
	menu = true: Whether players which are part of this race have a formspec inventory menu... containing their inventory, crafting area, etc.
	inventory_main = {x = 8, y = 4}: Size of the main inventory for players which are part of this race.
	inventory_craft = {x = 1, y = 1}: Size of the craft area for players which are part of this race.
	reincarnates = true: Players that are part of this race can possess allied mobs, typically used for ghosts.

	eye_offset = {{x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}, {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}}: Camera offset for 1st and 3rd person views, used to adjust the camera to eye position for creatures of various shapes and sizes.
	fog = {r = 0, g = 0, b = 0}: If set, this fog color is seen by players who are part of this race.
	screen = "hud_*.png": If set, this image is applied over the screen. Use a transparent image here, unless you wish to block the player's vision entirely.
	ambience = "ambient_*": If set, the player will constantly hear this ambiental sound.
	player_join = function(player) ... end: Function executed when a player joins. By default, this should call the logic_player_join function.
	player_step = function(player, dtime) ... end: Function executed each step. By default, this should call the logic_player_step function.
	player_die = function(player) ... end: Function executed when the player dies. By default, this should call the logic_player_die function.
	player_respawn = function(player) ... end: Function executed when the player respawns. By default, this should call the logic_player_respawn function.

- Module parameters:
	custom = {mymod = {param1 = "test", param2 = 0, ...} ...}: Allows defining custom properties for modules (sub-mods). For example, if a creature uses a module called "mymod", add specific parameters as mymod = { x = 0, y = 1, ... } to this list, and read them as custom.mymod.x, custom.mymod.y, etc. in the mod.
	traits = {mytrait = {0.25, 0.75}, ...}: Apart from the default traits, custom personality traits for modules may also be defined, as long as they use the same format (mytrait = {min_value, max_value}).
	on_* = function(...) & player_* = function(...): You can include functions from your modules in the builtin execution functions, to run custom code for players and mobs. For example, in on_step, you can add a mymod_step() function after the essential logic_mob_step() function.

* creatures:register_spawn("creatures:human", {"default:dirt_with_grass"}, 20, -1, 9000, 1, 31000, nil): Configures a mob to spawn on a given node. Parameters:
	name: The name of this creature, eg: creatures:human
	nodes: A list of nodes that this spawn applies for, eg: {"default:dirt_with_grass", ...}
	max_light: Maximum light value at which the mob spawns.
	min_light: Minimum light value at which the mob spawns.
	chance: The greater this value, the lower the chances that this mob will spawn. A good default is 10000.
	active_object_count: When there are more mobs than this, the spawn will deactivate. Don't abuse this, too many mobs can greatly decrease server performance!
	max_height: Maximum height this spawner will work at. (TODO: Also add a min_height)
	spawn_func: Custom spawn function.

* creatures:register_arrow("creatures:fireball", {...}): Defines a projectile, used by mobs with the "shoot" attack type. Parameters:
	visual = "sprite": Visual type of the projectile.
	visual_size = {x=1, y=1}: Scale of the projectile visual.
	textures = {"mobs_fireball.png"}: Texture of the projectile visual.
	velocity = 5: Velocity at which the projectile travels.
	hit_player = function(self, player) {...}: Function which executes when the projectile hits a player. Use player:punch to apply damage.

* Scripting - Public functions:
	creatures.selected[player]: The creature which was last right-clicked by 'player'.
	creatures:player_get(player): Gets the race of a player as a table: [1] = name, [2] = skin
	creatures:player_set(player, settings): Sets the race of a player from a table: [1] = name, [2] = skin
	creatures:alliance(creature1, creature2): Returns the alliance between two mobs and / or players, ranging between -1 and 1.
	creatures:can_possess(player, creature): Checks whether a player can possess a creature.
	creatures:possess(player, creature): Causes a player to possess a creature if possible.

* Scripting - Formspec:
	A formspec should be defined for each creature, in order to allow interaction between players and mobs (including possession). Formspec settings should be defined together with creatures, ideally as a common function.
	The formspec is shown to the player by calling minetest.show_formspec(clicker:get_player_name(), "creatures:formspec", formspec) from the creature's on_rightclick function. The formname must always be "creatures:formspec"!
	Whenever a player right-clicks a mob, their creatures.selected entry is updated. Therefore you can reference the mob the formspec is referring to as creatures.selected[clicker].
	The formspec can contain its own fields, which can be read using a custom minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields function. Below are the builtin fields, which buttons or other elements can trigger:
		possess: When this field is received, the player will possess the creature.
